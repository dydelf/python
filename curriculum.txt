"""

This is a plan for learning python programming.

"""

- Do the book Automate boring stuff
- Make project from video course
- Start making 10 applications from a video course
- Start doing the book that Michal gave me about proper python coding
- Make a learning log web application
- Start learning math during the meantime
- Start courses on machine learning


Things to do in the meantime of bigger projects:
- project euler
- project population {along with machine learning}
- algorithms from Michal {along with machine learning}
- bash scripting
- python regular expressions
- writing unit tests, have to be done all the time


Weird ideas:
- papa_invasion
- game of life


Upgraded plan after watching Siraj Raval:
1. Finish 10 applications course
2. Watch one video from calculus and linear algebra a day (25 days)
   Make the learning log app from the crash course book
3. Watch the math of intelligence by Siraj
4. Start the Data course on The School of AI
5. Do the book about tensorflow and ai

6. In meantime do the book automate the boring stuff and the book from Michal

Yet another upgraded and simplier plan, more realistic
1. Finish 10 applicatons cours
2. Start writing tests for everything that I write and have written
2. Watch math short movies
3. Make learning log app
4. Start making my own applications about my interests and topics
5. Do the book automate the boring stuff with python
6. Book from Michal about better python code
7. In the meantime after the math start watching courses about databases and algorithms
8. Finish making interesting applications of my own interests
9. Prepare for interviews
10. Start applying

Future plans:
1. Data lit course from Siraj Raval
2. The math of intelligence
3. Book about the tensorflow and scikit learn
