# This is a simple journal to record my journey through programming #

Beginning
Its hard to sum it up but I am around 1-2 weeks inside the programming journey
now. I completed some chapters from python crash course which gave me a really
basic view over programming. I am working on linux machine and slowly learning
everything I need to know to be more proficient.

02.03.19
I learned how to make functions in python. I also wrote some programs for euler
and hackerrank. This showed me the complexity of programming and how it can
beautifully fit together. There is a lot to learn still. I also started
configuring git and now I am able to save all changes on github.

03.03.19
I learned a lot about terminal this day and also decided to move mostly to
terminal operations. This should profit in the future as I am more able to move
through console. I changed my text editor to vim and started configuring it.

04.03.19
Finished learning functions chapter from python crash course. Also finished
configuring vim program to suit my personal needs. That was an intensive day
but now I am able to use vim quite comfortably. Still not sure if its worth it.

05.03.19
Added some functionality to vim program. Finished chapters on functions and
started learning python classes. Now it kind of makes more sense how can you
write such a complicated big programs. Solved some math problems in the phone
but without compiling.

06.03.19
Started to compile noted programs. So many bugs XD its better to write them
straight in a text editor, in the morning i had troubles recalling what was it
all about. I am at the beginning after all. After spending few hours I managed
to make both of them work. Optimalisation is shit, my computer can barely
calculate all the operations. Not because of the power but because of the
shitty beginner code.
